## Scope
The scope of this project is to build a 2D videogame inspired by the 2012 Global Game Jame theme, the Ouroboros. The ouroboro's symbol has many meanings according to different cultures but more generally is a circular symbol that depicts a snake or dragon devouring its own tail and that is used especially to represent the eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth. The main goals of the game are:
* Provide a playful game for the user;
* Inserting solution logic with increasing difficulty;
* Provide maxims that make the user reflect on the meaning of life.

## Snake's meaning
Historically, serpents and snakes represent fertility or a creative life force. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing.The ouroboros is a symbol of eternity and continual renewal of life.

## Game's Story [1st level]
The protagonist of the game is a Coral snake called Venom [https://www.everythingreptiles.com/snake-names/] that lives in a forest of the Tian Shan mountains (祁连) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Shan]. As well known, Coral snakes most are very elusive, fossorial (burrowing) snakes which spend most of their time buried beneath the ground or in the leaf litter of a rainforest floor, coming to the surface only when it rains or during breeding season [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_snake].

Fed up with his monotonous life, Venom decides to explore the outside world to better understand the meaning of his existence and elevate his spirit. He soon realizes that the outside world is full of pitfalls and animals never seen before: being the least aggressive of predators (considering the cautious and conservative nature of Coral snakes) he understands right away that he will have to use his intellectual skills to be able to escape the pitfalls that will arise ahead of him.

On the first level, Venom explores the first new world ahead of itself: A semi-deserted forest with sparse vegetation. Everything seems to be perpetrated in this strange calm when suddenly he meets Severus, a treacherous cobra snake who only aims at his interests, to intimidate all animals weaker than him. Venom does not have any items available and as a snake it can not in the least compare to Severus, too strong to fight a duel. Everything seems to take a bad turn when suddenly, a "box" appears in front of him. Venom smashes it to see what's inside and finds a piece of paper that says:

*Tai sabaki (体捌き)*

*Tai sabaki is usually used to avoid an attack, such that the receiver of the attack ends up in an advantageous position and it is often wrongly referred to as evasion. It relates to 'whole body movement', or repositioning. It can be translated as body-management.* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_sabaki]

Read the message Venom understands that his lack of strength to attack Severus can be replaced by his own agility, so that, through the movement of his own body, he will have to be able to exploit the strength of his opponent and project it on himself. Severus seems to be increasingly in trouble and in an attempt to intimidate Venom with seemingly random moves, he tends to intertwine himself until in an attempt to bite his opponent, he bites himself and dies painfully from his own venom.

Venom is shocked at the sight of this, he has learned 2 great lessons from this battle:
* Leaving every Comfort zone in our life existence involves facing pitfalls unknown to us;
* The evaluation of our abilities is often underestimated, but in reality each of us has great potential, we just need to understand how to find out;

At the end of the level Venom was able to insert the Tae Sabaki technique in his archive of learned techniques and acquired two experience points for having correctly learned the lesson.
