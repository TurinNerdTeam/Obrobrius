## Scope
The scope of this project is to build a 2D videogame inspired by the 2012 Global Game Jame theme, the Ouroboros. The ouroboro's symbol has many meanings according to different cultures but more generally is a circular symbol that depicts a snake or dragon devouring its own tail and that is used especially to represent the eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth. The main goals of the game are:
* Provide a playful game for the user;
* Inserting solution logic with increasing difficulty;
* Provide maxims that make the user reflect on the meaning of life.

## Snake's meaning
Historically, serpents and snakes represent fertility or a creative life force. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing.The ouroboros is a symbol of eternity and continual renewal of life.

## Game's Story [1st level]
The protagonist of the game is a Pocket Gopher called Brave that lives in a forest of the Tian Shan mountains (祁连) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Shan]. As well known, Pocket Gophers most are very elusive, fossorial (burrowing) animals which spend most of their time buried beneath the ground or in the leaf litter of a rainforest floor, coming to the surface only when it's night or during breeding season [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher]. They are commonly known for their extensive tunneling activities and their ability to destroy farms and gardens.

Brave's life could be summed up in small and simple routines: wake up in the night, leave the den to go get food, take it to the den, eat and fall asleep at the first dawns. His dan could be considered a very large burrow! On the other hand you know, as well known, all pocket gophers create network of tunnel systems that provide protection and a means of collecting food. 

Fed up with his monotonous life, Brave decides to explore the outside world to better understand the meaning of his existence, elevate his spirit and, why not? Meet new friends! His grandfather's words come to mind: *"The outside world is mortal, survival is difficult for us Gophers, but it's still a beautiful world. Don't limit your life to your lair, open your eyes and your mind, there is much more than you imagine out there and it's just waiting for you .. "*. His grandfather was truly a great Gopher adventurer, famous throughout the community for having explored the edges of the forest and having passed the great sacred oak (considered by all to be an unreachable place).

Taken by the same adventurous spirit of his grandfather, he decides to stop the monotonous life he had always lived, starting from the circadine rhythms! So he decides to take a backpack with food inside, fill his pillow bags in the same way and leave the den the next morning. He soon realizes that the outside world is full of pitfalls and animals never seen before: being just a borrowing rodents couldn't help with predators. He understands right away that he will have to use his intellectual skills to be able to escape the pitfalls that will arise ahead of him.

On the first level, Brave explores the first new world ahead of itself: A semi-deserted forest with sparse vegetation. Everything seems to be perpetrated in this strange calm when suddenly he meets Severus, a treacherous cobra snake who only aims at his interests, to intimidate all animals weaker than him. Venom does not have any items available and as a Pocket Gopher it can not in the least compare to Severus, too strong to fight a duel. Everything seems to take a bad turn when suddenly, he sees different boxex appears in front of him in an apparently random position. Brave goes close to one of themand finds a piece of paper that says:

*Tai sabaki (体捌き)*

*Tai sabaki is usually used to avoid an attack, such that the receiver of the attack ends up in an advantageous position and it is often wrongly referred to as evasion. It relates to 'whole body movement', or repositioning. It can be translated as body-management.*

*Hone your skills. GG* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_sabaki]

Read the message Brave understands that his lack of strength to attack Severus can be replaced by his own agility, so that, through the movement of his own body, he will have to be able to exploit the strength of his opponent and project it on himself. He realizes that by moving those boxes to certain points in the forest maze, he could have forced Venom to go to a restricted area. So he did. Severus seems to be increasingly in trouble and in an attempt to intimidate Venom with seemingly random moves, he tends to intertwine himself until in an attempt to bite his opponent, he bites himself and dies painfully from his own venom.

Brave is shocked at the sight of this, he has learned 2 great lessons from this battle:
* Leaving every Comfort zone in our life existence involves facing pitfalls unknown to us;
* The evaluation of our abilities is often underestimated, but in reality each of us has great potential, we just need to understand how to find out;

At the end of the level Brave was able to insert the Tae Sabaki technique in his archive of learned techniques and acquired two experience points for having correctly learned the lesson.
